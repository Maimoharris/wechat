/* This is a placeholder for the default avatar image.
   In a real project, you would need to provide an actual image file.
   Since we can't include binary files in this example, this file serves as a reminder.
   
   Users will need to place a default-avatar.png file in this directory,
   or update the User model to use an external image URL instead. */
